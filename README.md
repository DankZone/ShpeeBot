### Self-hosting

Good news - You can host Shpee for free on Glitch!

See the [wiki on how to set up Shpee](https://github.com/DankZone/ShpeeBot/wiki).

### Invite Public Bot

~~Invite Shpee by DankZone through the Shpee website! <https://shpee.dankzone.xyz/>.~~  
The public bot is not currently maintained as I focus on making Shpee version 9.

### Customisable
Shpee has a web dashboard so you can change the settings to your server's needs! Check out the dashboard at <https://shpee.dankzone.xyz/>.

## Changes to the Code

You may change code if needed under the following conditions:

For the dashboard, you may change the theme, wording, design, links, etc. however I will not accept any bug reports coming from this. You will also agree to **not remove the copyright notice in the footer. You may add your name here, however, you must keep the original wording used**.

**ALL** copyright notices and credits **must** be kept as is, not edited in any way (except for adding your own name) and not removed.

## Contributing

Shpee is open-source on our GitHub repository so everyone in the community can contribute to the growth of the bot. Whether it is from reporting issues, requesting features, or straight-up requesting to add some new code, it can all be done on our GitHub repo!

Shpee is written in Discord.js. If you want to add a feature or work on the code, feel free make a pull request.
